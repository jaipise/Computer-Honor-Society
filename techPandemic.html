            	Mundane everyday routines were put to a stop thanks to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 virus has been infecting individuals since December of 2019. There is no guaranteed answer as to how the outbreak happened, but the understanding for how the index case got infected is that they contracted the virus when they consumed soup, a soup which had bat as its primary ingredient. The virus has been around for approximately ten months now. There have been myriad of advances towards the vaccine for this pandemic, a result of modern science and technology.

            	In a broader perspective, technology has always been making human tasks easier and more efficient. It is a massive helping hand, especially during these difficult times where everyone is required to stay at least six feet, or a little less than two metres, away from another person. Technology stores any data related to every little patient in medical care; technology even allows medical professionals to monitor any changes in coronavirus patient’s remote, limiting the risk of them getting infected. Not only that, but technology is in every little thing that helps professionals to their work these days. Thermal scanners, to see if there is any high temperature in the body, thermometers, etc. Technology also has helped tremendously with the creation of the vaccine to the virus.

            	Vaccines are modified versions of the actual disease. Weakened, making it difficult to spread throughout the body and infect the person. This is the technique used for the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, chickenpox, influenza, and other vaccines. A common misconception is that vaccines cause the disease, which is false; they are unable to infect anything due to the modifications that are done on them. However, there are many different approaches to how the COVID-19 vaccine will be. Professor Robin Shattock - a professional who works at the Department of Infectious Diseases at Imperial College London, has another approach to the vaccine. Approaching the vaccine by self-amplifying RNA (strands of genetic code) so that once the vaccine enters the body, the RNA will self amplify, therefore making copies of itself. This should be able to make the immune system of the body recognise the virus rapidly and defend itself against it.

            	This pandemic has been a harsh reality check to everyone worldwide. Immeasurable amounts of people were not allowed to leave their houses for months on end. And still cannot, based on the situation that their environment is in. Many relationships have suffered; nonetheless, technology is still helping people keep in contact with friends, family and multiple other loved ones across the globe. The pandemic should be almost over; all we can do now is to do our part by wearing masks, social distancing, wash our hands and keep our lifestyle healthy.
